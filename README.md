# collecting_data course Project (TBD)

This is the repository I will use for the Collecting data course.

I will upload all the datasets i need to complete the collecting_data assignments and final project. Some of them will also maybe used for the tools_and_method_course.

I have yet to develop an appropriate research question. All I know is that I would like to focus on the area of cultural heritage and why not also people's perceptions of it. I therefore imagine that I will mainly use existing datasets provided by museum institutions and may have to create my own with people's answers/reactions/perceptions.

For what concerns museum's collections datasets, fortunately many are provided by the museums themselves on this very platform. However, these are mostly very copious datasets that require the use of a GitHub extension: Git Large File Storage. Data collection from social platforms, primarily instagram, will probably also prove useful. https://www.istat.it/it/dati-analisi-e-prodotti/banche-dati/statbase collects some datasets regarding tourism related figures. 

The first dataset, 'artists.csv' was uploaded to test the functioning of GitHub. It contains all the names of the artists registered by the MOMA Museum. The Artists dataset contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have worked in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in the database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID. (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7269353) The columns are: ConstituentID int NOT NULL, DisplayName varchar NOT NULL, ArtistBio varchar (nationality, birth-year/death-year) NULL, Nationality varchar NULL, Gender varchar NULL, BeginDate int NOT NULL,EndDate int NOT NULL, Wiki QID varchar NULL, ULAN int NULL. 
This dataset is publicly available and accessible in the dedicated reposirtoy of the same museum, after clearly appropriate attribution via DOI. It is not specified who was in charge of digitising this data, but being a renowned institution, I imagine they used specialised curators.

Also uploaded are the three assignments that characterised this course: Assignment 3 on web scraping, Assignment 4 and 5 on data visualisation, and the final individual project that aims to combine all this newly acquired knowledge.
