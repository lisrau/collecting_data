# collecting_data
This is the repository I will use for the Collecting data course.
At the moment, only a MOMA dataset containing all the names of the artists registered by the Museum has been uploaded. 

The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museumâ€™s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.

The Artists dataset contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in the database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.(DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7269353)
